# Final Project Submission

## Overview

This repository contains the final project submission for GIT418. The project involves building a single-page website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which can be included in your portfolio. The site can be for a real or fictional company or person, and it should demonstrate your skills in front-end web development.

## Project Requirements

The project consists of two main parts:

1. **Coded Website**:
   - The website should be a single page and display properly at 1280px wide.
   - All content should resemble a real, stand-alone website, with high-quality text and images.
   - The code should be well-organized, properly indented, well-commented, and validated without errors or warnings.
   - There should be no JavaScript or CSS inline in the HTML file.
   - JavaScript should use strict mode globally.
   - The JavaScript file should be linked in the header with the async or defer attribute.
   - Required features include:
     - jQuery Widget/Plugin
     - Ajax/API usage
     - Web Storage usage
     - Slideshow/Carousel

2. **Behance Project**:
   - Prepare a Behance project that explains your process, including project requirements, goals, steps taken, tools used, and future steps.
   - Include wireframes or mockups, if available.
   - **Do not include any code screenshots or files in the Behance project**.

## Tips for Success

- Start early and plan your project carefully.
- Ask for help if needed.
